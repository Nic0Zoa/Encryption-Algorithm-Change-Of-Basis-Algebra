# Change of Basis. Algebra 

Given a certain matrix, this code encrypts and decrypts every message you can imagine.

There are certain conditions to keep in mind:

1. There are 29 different characters, that contains the 27 traditional letters from the alphaber and two additional ones.
    - The first addition is an undersocre *"_"* that represents a gap or a blank space.
    - The second addition is our classic dot *"."*, you can use it whenever you wante

2. Every message you want to write has to be written in uppercase, while every gap you want to write has to be written with an undersocere


This is an example:
- Suposse you want to encrypt *Good morning*

The code will ask you for the string of characters you will use, given the two conditions mentioned before, you will have to write this string as it is showed right below:

- *GOOD_MORNING*

The rest is pure magic.

Enjoy, I will try to keep updating this as new ideas comes to mynd. That's all for now
