# Change of Basis. Algebra 

Let's encrypt something. This code works in an easy way. Given a certain matrix, that we call the key, you can encrypt and decrypt any message you want.

There are some things to keep in mind for the process.

1. All has to be written in uppercase
2. If you want to add a gap between words, you have to write an underscore

Let's see an example.

Suposse you want to encrypt the following message: *Good morning, I am Daniel*
First, the program will ask you for the size of the matrix, and its elements. In other words, your key.

Now, given the instructions described right above, the message will be turned in the following: *GOOD_MORNING._I_AM_DANIEL.*

And that´s it, the program is very clear at each step, so we won´t explain that in this file.


P.S. 
I add an exectuable file into the dist folder, this way you won't have to run it from a terminal. Just use the executable.

That's all for now.
